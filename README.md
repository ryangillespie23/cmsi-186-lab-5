# CMSI 186 Lab 5 Pod Racing Starter Code

This repository contains some unfinished Java programs that you are complete.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and write the code according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/5/). Use the provided test scripts.

In your new repository, don’t forget to edit this README file, as _your_ repository will certainly not contain any unfinished Java programs.
